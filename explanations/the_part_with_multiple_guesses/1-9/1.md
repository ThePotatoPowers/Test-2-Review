# Question 1
## Question
Given the boolean expression:
```java
!(p && b) && (!p || b)
```
Which of the following conditions must be true for the expression to evaluate to true?

a) p is true  
b) p is false  
c) p and b have the same truth value  
d) p and b have different truth values   
e) None of these
## Answer
### Method 1 - Parse expression
You can "simply" break the expression apart in your brain.

1. `!(p && b)` and `(!p || b)` must both be true.
2. `(p && b)` must be false and `(!p || b)` must be true.
3. Parse each statement individually
	1. At least one of `p` and `b` must be false
		1. if `p` is false, `b` can be true or false
		2. if `b` is false, `p` can be true or false
	2. At least one of `!p` and `b` must be true
		1. if `b` is true, `!p` can be true or false.
		2. therefore `p` can be true or false if `b` is true
		3. if `b` is false, `!p` must be true
		4. therefore `p` must be false if `b` is false
4. 

### Method 2 - Each case
Since there are only two boolean values, you could test each case, because there are only four. 

1. `p` is true and `b` is true
2. `p` is false and `b` is true
3. `p` is true and `b` is false
4. `p` is false and `b` is false
