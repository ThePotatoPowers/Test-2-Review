# Question 1
## Question
Given the boolean expression:
```java
!(p && b) && (!p || b)
```
Which of the following conditions must be true for the expression to evaluate to true?

a) p is true  
b) p is false  
c) p and b have the same truth value  
d) p and b have different truth values   
e) None of these
## Answer

Since there are only two boolean values, you could test each case, because there are only four. 

1. `p` is true and `b` is true
2. `p` is false and `b` is true
3. `p` is true and `b` is false
4. `p` is false and `b` is false
