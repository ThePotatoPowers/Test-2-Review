# Question 4
## Question
After this loop has finished, what is the value of i?
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 8) {
	System.out.print(i);
	i += 1;
}
```
a) 6  
b) 7  
c) 8  
d) 9  
e) 0  
## Answer
Again, it helps to visualize each step of the loop.
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
